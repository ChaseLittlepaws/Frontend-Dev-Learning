# A Static Site Front End Development Learning Curriculum
```toc

## Introduction
I developed this list for my own learning, but I'm sharing it to practice [learning in public](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public/). As of 22.07.24, all of these resources are available and, unless otherwise indicated, free. The technologies list is in order and later resources rely on the skills from earlier ones, while the other competencies list varies. I try to maintain at least one resource and a maximum of eight for each topic.
