# A Text-Based Adventure Learning Curriculum
```toc
```
## Introduction
I developed this for a friend who wanted a clear path on how to create text-based games. I created this list by finding the tools that a developer would use (Twine and Inform 7), and reverse engineering them to find a direct path. I also included resources on how to create a static site to the host the game. I am sharing this as part of the ideal of [learning in public](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public/).
