# frontend-dev-learning

Hello world! I collected and curated these resources for my own learning, and I'm sharing them with you as a practice of [learning in public](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public/). I will update these resources and add more context as time goes on.
 
If you have resources to add, please feel free to reach out. Thank you.
